# Elevator-doubly-LinkedList
This class implements the linked list data structure. The Floor nodes are stored in the linked list which is presented by the pointer to its first node and its last node. The pointer to the first node is stored in the m_ground member variable and the pointer to the last node is stored in the m_top member variable. The member variable m_ground carries the lowest floor number and the member variable m_top carries the highest floor number. 


# What I Learned

- Implementing more efficient linked list routines, i.e. insertion and removal.
- Practice C++ dynamic memory management, i.e. avoiding memory leaks, avoiding double free, protection against wrong    accesses in memory (segmentation fault), etc.
- Practice writing test cases for a project.
